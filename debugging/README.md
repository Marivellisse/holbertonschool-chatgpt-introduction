# Debugging with ChatGPT ü§ñ

Welcome to the `debugging` directory of the **Holberton School ChatGPT Introduction Project**.  
This module focuses on using AI (ChatGPT) to identify, understand, and fix bugs in code samples, while also improving automation and documentation skills.

---

## üß† Objectives

- Use ChatGPT to **debug** real-world code across multiple programming languages.
- Learn how to **automate** repetitive tasks like documentation and test creation.
- Practice **writing clean, readable, and functional code**.
- Integrate basic **error handling** and input validation.

## üìÅ Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `factorial.py` | Fixed infinite loop in factorial function using a while loop. |
| `print_arguments.py` | Skips the script name and prints only passed arguments. |
| `change_background.html` | Fixed JavaScript by correcting button ID for event handling. |
| `mines.py` | Minesweeper game with added win condition and full input handling. |
| `factorial_recursive.py` | Recursive factorial function with full docstring. |
| `checkbook.py` | Added error handling for non-numeric input and added documentation. |
| `tic.py` | Fully functional Tic Tac Toe game with input validation and win/draw detection. |

## üöÄ How to Run

To test each file locally:

```bash
./factorial.py 5
./print_arguments.py one two three
python3 checkbook.py
python3 mines.py
python3 tic.py
```

For HTML file:

- Open `change_background.html` in a web browser and click the button.

## üìù Notes

- All Python files are executable and follow Python 3 syntax.
- Files are ready for testing using Holberton‚Äôs automated checker system.
- All functions are documented and structured with clarity.
